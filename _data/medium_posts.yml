- title: "Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the News: Are they Overreacting?"
  subtitle: I scraped over 5,000 news articles to find out
  date: 12/03/2020
  excerpt: With the onset of Coronavirus (COVID-19), many people are turning to the media 
           to assess the severity of the situation. Some are saying that the media is overreacting, 
           portraying a situation that is far worse than reality. Others believe that the media is 
           strictly portraying the facts, i.e., not trying to persuade us one way or another. 
           How can we determine which is actually happening?

- title: An Introduction to Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  subtitle: Using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for Regression
  date: 03/03/2020
  excerpt: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are well known in classification problems. 
            The use of SVMs in regression is not as well documented, however. 
            These types of models are known as Support Vector Regression (SVR).
            In this article, I will walk through the usefulness in SVR compared to other regression models, 
            do a deep-dive into the math behind the algorithm, and provide an example with the Boston Housing Price dataset.

  excerpt: In today’s Data Science hyped world, organizations are increasingly looking for answers 
          from the data they collect. The good news is, this means more business leaders are turning 
          towards data-driven decision making. Unfortunately though, this often turns into you as a 
          Data Analyst / Scientist going on a wild goose chase for answers that may or may not be in the data.
