  excerpt: In today’s Data Science hyped world, organizations are increasingly looking for answers 
          from the data they collect. The good news is, this means more business leaders are turning 
          towards data-driven decision making. Unfortunately though, this often turns into you as a 
          Data Analyst / Scientist going on a wild goose chase for answers that may or may not be in the data.

- title: An Introduction to Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  subtitle:
  date: 03/03/2020
  excerpt: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are well known in classification problems. 
            The use of SVMs in regression is not as well documented, however. 
            These types of models are known as Support Vector Regression (SVR).
            In this article, I will walk through the usefulness in SVR compared to other regression models, 
            do a deep-dive into the math behind the algorithm, and provide an example with the Boston Housing Price dataset.
